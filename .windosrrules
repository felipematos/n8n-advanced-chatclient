# Chat behaviour

- Be concise and direct with your messages, no need for detailed explanations.
- Don't tell me what needs to be done. Just do it, using all available tools.
- If the main file edit and serach tools fail, try using terminal commands, instead, in order to complete your task.
- Be extremely cautious when removing code. Always double check if the code is being used in other parts of the codebase before removing it, so you don't break the application.
- When you are not sure about something, check the docs and search the web for answers. If you're still not sure, ask for help. Never perform any action if you are not sure about it.
- Think about the consequences of your actions before you perform them. If you think they may harm or break the application, don't do them.


# Commit Rules:

- Never edit files in the stable folder, unless when preparing a Stable Commit.
- Never assume a commit is stable unless explicitly specified.
- Check the latest version number in the previous commit, and increment it (0.0.X for minor changes, 0.X.0 for less minor changes, and X.0.0 for major changes). 
- Update the version number in the comments at the top of each modified file. E.g. "// v0.6.24".
- Write a simple, concise commit message, starting with the incremented version number. Add "*not stable*" to the end, when the commit is not a stable one. E.g. "v1.5.1 fix: multiple buttons now rendering. *not stable*".
- Prepare the commit, but wait for my review before actually executing it.

# Additional Rules for Stable Commits:

- Copy the content of files in the root folder to their versions in "stable" folder. Both versions should be identifical, except for file paths and version comments. In some cases, the stable version would have "-latest" added to its name. E.g. "chat-widhget.js" -> "chat-widget-latest.js", "demo.html" --> "demo-latest.html". In other cases, files would have the same name in both folders (E.g. prompt.md, README.md, etc). Verify each case and change the correct files accordingly.
- In "demo-latest.html" change the file path to make sure the script being loaded is the stable "chat-widget-latest.js". Use the Github pages full path: "https://felipematos.github.io/n8n-advanced-chatclient/stable/chat-widget-latest.js".
- Make sure that the code generated by the script that creates the code to insert the chat widget into a page uses the stable version in full path (Github pages).
- In "chat-widget-latest.js", check for file paths and make sure the files being loaded are the ones in the stable folder, and in full path (Github pages).
- Check for any other file loading blocks in the codebase and make sure the files being loaded are the ones in the stable folder, and in full path (Github pages).
- Add "Stable" to the version number commented at the begining of each modified file. E.g. "// version 0.3.1 Stable"
- Add "*Stable*" to the end of the commit message. E.g. "v1.5.1 add: new list action object. *Stable*".
- Wait for my review before executing the commit.
